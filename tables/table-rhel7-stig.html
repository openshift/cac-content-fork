have hashes that differ from what is expected by the RPM database:
<pre>$ rpm -Va --noconfig | grep '^..5'</pre>
A "c" in the second column indicates that a file is a configuration file, which
may appropriately be expected to change. If the file was not expected to
change, investigate the cause of the change using audit logs or other means.
The package can then be reinstalled to restore the file.
Run the following command to determine which package owns the file:
<pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>
The package can be reinstalled from a yum repository using the command:
<pre>$ sudo yum reinstall <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>

<td>The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must not forward IPv6 source-routed packets.</td>

forward the packet along a different path than configured on the router, which can
be used to bypass network security measures. This requirement applies only to the
forwarding of source-routerd traffic, such as when IPv6 forwarding is enabled and

$ sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route
The output of the command should indicate a value of 0.
The preferable way how to assure the runtime compliance is to have
correct persistent configuration, and rebooting the system.

The persistent kernel parameter configuration is performed by specifying the appropriate
assignment in any file located in the /etc/sysctl.d directory.
Verify that there is not any existing incorrect configuration by executing the following command:
$ grep -r '^\s*net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route\s*=' /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d
If any assignments other than
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
are found, or the correct assignment is duplicated, remove those offending lines from respective files,
and make sure that exactly one file in
/etc/sysctl.d contains net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0, and that one assignment
is returned when
$ grep -r net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d

This rule checks if the file exists and if it contains required parameters and values which modify the Crypto Policy.
During the parsing process, as soon as Openssh client parses some configuration option and its value, it remembers it and ignores any subsequent overrides. The customization mechanism provided by crypto policies appends eventual customizations at the end of the system wide crypto policy. Therefore, if the crypto policy customization overrides some parameter which is already configured in the system wide crypto policy, the SSH client will not honor that customized parameter.</td>

<td>Encrypt Partitions</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS 4 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br><br>
For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.

<br><br>
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <code>--encrypted</code> and <code>--passphrase=</code> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <code>--passphrase=</code> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br><br>
By default, the <code>Anaconda</code> installer uses <code>aes-xts-plain64</code> cipher
with a minimum <code>512</code> bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.

<br><br>
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS 4 Documentation web site:<br>

Note that the Red Hat OpenShift documentation often references a block
device, such as <code>/dev/vda</code>. The name of the available block devices depends
on the underlying infrastructure (bare metal vs cloud), and often the specific
instance type. For example in AWS, some instance types have NVMe drives
(<code>/dev/nvme*</code>), others use <code>/dev/xvda*</code>.

You will need to look for relevant documentation for your infrastructure around this.
In many cases, the simplest thing is to boot a single machine with an Ignition
configuration that just gives you SSH access, and inspect the block devices via
e.g. the <code>lsblk</code> command.

For physical hardware, a good best practice is to reference devices via the

To correctly identify unsuccessful creation, unsuccessful modification and unsuccessful access

<td>Disable the Automounter</td>

home directories shared via NFS, on demand. In addition, autofs can be used to handle
removable media, and the default configuration provides the cdrom device as <code>/misc/cd</code>.
However, this method of providing access to removable media is not common, so autofs
can almost always be disabled if NFS is not in use. Even if NFS is required, it may be
possible to configure filesystem mounts statically by editing <code>/etc/fstab</code>
rather than relying on the automounter.
<br><br>

The <code>autofs</code> service can be disabled with the following manifest:
<pre>
---
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
  name: 75-master-autofs-disable

    systemd:
      units:

</pre>
<p>
This will disable the <code>autofs</code> service in all the

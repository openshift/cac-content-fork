When the so-called 'sticky bit' is set on a directory,
only the owner of a given file may remove that file from the
directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a
directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky
bit prevents users from removing each other's files. In cases where
there is no reason for a directory to be world-writable, a better
solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application,
consult that application's documentation instead of blindly
changing modes.

following command:

Failing to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized
users to delete files in the directory structure.

The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories
supplied with the system, or those designed to be temporary file
repositories. The setting is normally reserved for directories used by the

The targeted users of a user specification should be, as much as possible, non privileged users (i.e.: non-root).

It is common that the command to be executed does not require superuser rights (editing a file

  <td>Don't define allowed commands in sudoers by means of exclusion</td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">
Policies applied by sudo through the sudoers file should not involve negation.

Each user specification in the <code>sudoers</code> file contains a comma-delimited list of command specifications.
The definition can make use glob patterns, as well as of negations.
Indirect definition of those commands by means of exclusion of a set of commands is trivial to bypass, so it is not allowed to use such constructs.
  </td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">
Specifying access right using negation is inefficient and can be easily circumvented.
For example, it is expected that a specification like <pre>
# To avoid absolutely , this rule can be easily circumvented!
user ALL = ALL ,!/ bin/sh
</pre> prevents the execution of the shell
but that’s not the case: just copy the binary <code>/bin/sh</code> to a different name to make it executable
again through the rule keyword <code>ALL</code>.

All commands in the sudoers file must strictly specify the arguments allowed to be used for a given user.

  </td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">
Any argument can modify quite significantly the behavior of a program, whether regarding the
realized operation (read, write, delete, etc.) or accessed resources (path in a file system tree). To
avoid any possibility of misuse of a command by a user, the ambiguities must be removed at the
level of its specification.

For example, on some systems, the kernel messages are only accessible by root.
If a user nevertheless must have the privileges to read them, the argument of the dmesg command has to be restricted
in order to prevent the user from flushing the buffer through the -c option:
<pre>
user ALL = dmesg ""

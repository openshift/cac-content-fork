The Libreswan package provides an implementation of IPsec

untrusted networks. The <code>libreswan</code> package can be installed with the following command:
<pre>

  <td>Ensure Red Hat GPG Key Installed</td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">
To ensure the system can cryptographically verify base software packages
come from Red Hat (and to connect to the Red Hat Network to receive them),
the Red Hat GPG key must properly be installed. To install the Red Hat GPG
key, run:
<pre>$ sudo subscription-manager register</pre>

If the system is not connected to the Internet or an RHN Satellite, then
install the Red Hat GPG key from trusted media such as the Red Hat
installation CD-ROM or DVD. Assuming the disc is mounted in
<tt>/media/cdrom</tt>, use the following command as the root user to import
it into the keyring:
<pre>$ sudo rpm --import /media/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEY</pre>

Alternatively, the key may be pre-loaded during the RHEL installation. In
such cases, the key can be installed by running the following command:
<pre>sudo rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release</pre>

Changes to software components can have significant effects on the overall
security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has
not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.

The <tt>gpgcheck</tt> option controls whether
RPM packages' signatures are always checked prior to installation.

them, ensure the following line appears in <tt>/etc/yum.conf</tt> in
the <tt>[main]</tt> section:
<pre>gpgcheck=1</pre>

Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the
overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the
software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a

<br />
Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system
components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the
organization.
<br />Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation
validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor.
This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been
provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by
this requirement. Certificates used to verify the software must be from an
approved Certificate Authority (CA).

  <td>Ensure Software Patches Installed</td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">

If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server,
or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:
<pre>$ sudo yum update</pre>
If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form of RPM packages)
can be manually downloaded from the Red Hat Network and installed using <tt>rpm</tt>.

<br /><br />
NOTE: U.S. Defense systems are required to be patched within 30 days or sooner as local policy
dictates.
  </td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">
Installing software updates is a fundamental mitigation against
the exploitation of publicly-known vulnerabilities. If the most
recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized
users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The
lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.

Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended,
negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating
system. The operating system's Information Management Officer (IMO)/Information System
Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) must be notified via email and/or
monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.

  <td>Verify File Hashes with RPM</td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">
Without cryptographic integrity protections, system
executables and files can be altered by unauthorized users without
detection.
The RPM package management system can check the hashes of
installed software packages, including many that are important to system
security.
To verify that the cryptographic hash of system files and commands matches vendor
values, run the following command to list which files on the system
have hashes that differ from what is expected by the RPM database:
<pre>$ rpm -Va --noconfig | grep '^..5'</pre>
A "c" in the second column indicates that a file is a configuration file, which
may appropriately be expected to change. If the file was not expected to
change, investigate the cause of the change using audit logs or other means.
The package can then be reinstalled to restore the file.
Run the following command to determine which package owns the file:
<pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>
The package can be reinstalled from a yum repository using the command:
<pre>$ sudo yum reinstall <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>
Alternatively, the package can be reinstalled from trusted media using the command:
<pre>$ sudo rpm -Uvh <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>

The hashes of important files like system executables should match the
information given by the RPM database. Executables with erroneous hashes could

The RPM package management system can check file access permissions

Verify that the file permissions of system files

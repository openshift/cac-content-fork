<td>All OL 8 local disk partitions must implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure or modification of all information that requires at-rest protection.</td>
<td>The risk of a system's physical compromise, particularly mobile systems such as
laptops, places its data at risk of compromise.  Encrypting this data mitigates
the risk of its loss if the system is lost.</td>
<td>Check the system partitions to determine if they are encrypted with the following command:
blkid

Output will be similar to:
/dev/sda1: UUID=" ab12c3de-4f56-789a-8f33-3850cc8ce3a2
" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"
/dev/sda2: UUID=" bc98d7ef-6g54-321h-1d24-9870de2ge1a2
" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"

The boot partition and pseudo-file systems, such as /proc, /sys, and tmpfs,
are not required to use disk encryption and are not a finding.
      Is it the case that partitions do not have a type of crypto_LUKS?
      </td>
<td>Oracle Linux 8 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br><br>
For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.

<br><br>
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <code>--encrypted</code> and <code>--passphrase=</code> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <code>--passphrase=</code> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br><br>
By default, the <code>Anaconda</code> installer uses <code>aes-xts-plain64</code> cipher
with a minimum <code>512</code> bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.

<br><br>
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on
the Oracle Linux 8 Documentation web site:<br>

<td>When X11 forwarding is enabled, there may be additional exposure to the
server and client displays if the sshd proxy display is configured to listen
on the wildcard address. By default, sshd binds the forwarding server to the
loopback address and sets the hostname part of the <code>DISPLAY</code>
environment variable to localhost. This prevents remote hosts from
connecting to the proxy display.  </td>
<td>To determine how the SSH daemon's X11UseLocalhost option is set, run the following command:

$ sudo grep -i X11UseLocalhost /etc/ssh/sshd_config

If no line, a commented line, or a line indicating the value yes is returned, then the required value is set.
      Is it the case that the display proxy is listening on wildcard address?

<td>The SSH daemon should prevent remote hosts from connecting to the proxy
display.
<br>
The default SSH configuration for <code>X11UseLocalhost</code> is <code>yes</code>,
which prevents remote hosts from connecting to the proxy display.
<br>
To explicitly prevent remote connections to the proxy display, add or correct
the following line in


<code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:

<code>X11UseLocalhost yes</code>

<td>If the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server is required, the OL 8 TFTP daemon must be configured to operate in secure mode.</td>
<td>Using the <code>-s</code> option causes the TFTP service to only serve files from the
given directory. Serving files from an intentionally-specified directory
reduces the risk of sharing files which should remain private.</td>
<td>If TFTP is not installed, this is not applicable. To determine if TFTP is
installed, run the following command:
$ rpm -qa | grep tftp

Verify tftp is configured by with the -s option by
running the following command:
grep "server_args" /etc/xinetd.d/tftp
The output should indicate the server_args variable is configured
with the -s flag, matching the example below:
$ grep "server_args" /etc/xinetd.d/tftp
server_args = -s 
      Is it the case that this flag is missing?

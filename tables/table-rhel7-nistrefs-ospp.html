  <td xml:lang="en-US">
Single-user mode is intended as a system recovery
method, providing a single user root access to the system by
providing a boot option at startup. By default, no authentication
is performed if single-user mode is selected.
<br /><br />
By default, single-user mode is protected by requiring a password and is set
in <tt>/usr/lib/systemd/system/rescue.service</tt>.
  </td>

This prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing security
on the machine and gaining root access. Such accesses are further prevented
by configuring the bootloader password.

Without establishing what type of events occurred, it would be difficult
to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.
Ensuring the <tt>auditd</tt> service is active ensures audit records
generated by the kernel are appropriately recorded.

Additionally, a properly configured audit subsystem ensures that actions of
individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users so they
can be held accountable for their actions.

To ensure the SSH idle timeout occurs precisely when the

not recommended that hosts unilaterally trust one another, even

A TCP SYN flood attack can cause a denial of service by filling a
system's TCP connection table with connections in the SYN_RCVD state.
Syncookies can be used to track a connection when a subsequent ACK is received,

source. This feature is activated when a flood condition is detected, and

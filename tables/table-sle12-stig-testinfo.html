are accounts created in response to crisis situations, usually for use by
maintenance personnel. The automatic expiration or disabling time period
may be extended as needed until the crisis is resolved; however, it must
not be extended indefinitely. A permanent account should be established for

The organization must identify authorized software programs and permit

<td xml:lang="en-US">The risk of a system's physical compromise, particularly mobile systems such as
laptops, places its data at risk of compromise.  Encrypting this data mitigates
the risk of its loss if the system is lost.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br><br>
For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.

<br><br>
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on
the SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 Documentation web site:<br>

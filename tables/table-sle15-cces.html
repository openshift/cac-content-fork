<td>Verify File Hashes with RPM</td>
<td>Without cryptographic integrity protections, system
executables and files can be altered by unauthorized users without
detection.
The RPM package management system can check the hashes of
installed software packages, including many that are important to system
security.
To verify that the cryptographic hash of system files and commands matches vendor
values, run the following command to list which files on the system
have hashes that differ from what is expected by the RPM database:
<pre>$ rpm -Va --noconfig | grep '^..5'</pre>
A "c" in the second column indicates that a file is a configuration file, which
may appropriately be expected to change. If the file was not expected to
change, investigate the cause of the change using audit logs or other means.
The package can then be reinstalled to restore the file.
Run the following command to determine which package owns the file:
<pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>
The package can be reinstalled from a zypper repository using the command:
<pre>$ sudo zypper reinstall <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>
Alternatively, the package can be reinstalled from trusted media using the command:
<pre>$ sudo rpm -Uvh <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>

The rule checks if settings for selected crypto policy are configured as expected. Configuration files in the <code>/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends</code> are either symlinks to correct files provided by Crypto-policies package or they are regular files in case crypto policy customizations are applied.
Crypto policies may be customized by crypto policy modules, in which case it is delimited from the base policy using a colon.</td>

set up to ignore it.

To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, ensure that the <code>/etc/ipsec.conf</code>

is not commented out or superseded by later includes:
<code>include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config</code>

<td>Configure OpenSSL library to use System Crypto Policy</td>
<td>Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms usage of many packages.
OpenSSL is supported by crypto policy, but the OpenSSL configuration may be
set up to ignore it.
To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the OpenSSL config file
available under <code>/etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf</code>.
This file has the <code>ini</code> format, and it enables crypto policy support
if there is a <code>[ crypto_policy ]</code> section that contains the <code>.include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensslcnf.config</code> directive.</td>

To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, ensure that
the <code>CRYPTO_POLICY</code> variable is either commented or not set at all
in the <code>/etc/sysconfig/sshd</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Harden SSH client Crypto Policy</td>
<td>Crypto Policies are means of enforcing certain cryptographic settings for selected applications including OpenSSH client.
To override the system wide crypto policy for Openssh client, place a file in the <code>/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/</code> so that it is loaded before the <code>05-redhat.conf</code>. In this case it is file named <code>02-ospp.conf</code> containing parameters which need to be changed with respect to the crypto policy.
This rule checks if the file exists and if it contains required parameters and values which modify the Crypto Policy.
During the parsing process, as soon as Openssh client parses some configuration option and its value, it remembers it and ignores any subsequent overrides. The customization mechanism provided by crypto policies appends eventual customizations at the end of the system wide crypto policy. Therefore, if the crypto policy customization overrides some parameter which is already configured in the system wide crypto policy, the SSH client will not honor that customized parameter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Harden SSHD Crypto Policy</td>
<td>Crypto Policies are means of enforcing certain cryptographic settings for selected applications including OpenSSH server.
The SSHD service is by default configured to modify its configuration based on currently configured Crypto-Policy. However, in certain cases it might be needed to override the Crypto Policy specific to OpenSSH Server and leave rest of the Crypto Policy intact.
This can be done by dropping a file named <code>opensshserver-xxx.config</code>, replacing <code>xxx</code> with arbitrary identifier, into <code>/etc/crypto-policies/local.d</code>. This has to be followed by running <code>update-crypto-policies</code> so that changes are applied.
Changes are propagated into <code>/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config</code>. This rule checks if this file contains predefined <code>CRYPTO_POLICY</code> environment variable configured with predefined value.</td>

encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br><br>
For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.

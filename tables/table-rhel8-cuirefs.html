considered a risk, because it should not be possible to directly login into
a container anyway.

To further limit access to the <tt>root</tt> account, administrators
can disable root logins at the console by editing the <tt>/etc/securetty</tt> file.
This file lists all devices the root user is allowed to login to. If the file does
not exist at all, the root user can login through any communication device on the
system, whether via the console or via a raw network interface. This is dangerous
as user can login to the system as root via Telnet, which sends the password in
plain text over the network. By default, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8's
<tt>/etc/securetty</tt> file only allows the root user to login at the console
physically attached to the system. To prevent root from logging in, remove the
contents of this file. To prevent direct root logins, remove the contents of this
file by typing the following command:
<pre>
$ sudo echo &gt; /etc/securetty

Disabling direct root logins ensures proper accountability and multifactor
authentication to privileged accounts. Users will first login, then escalate

  <td>Encrypt Partitions</td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br /><br />
For manual installations, select the <tt>Encrypt</tt> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.

<br /><br />
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <tt>--encrypted</tt> and <tt>--passphrase=</tt> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <tt>--passphrase=</tt> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br /><br />
By default, the <tt>Anaconda</tt> installer uses <tt>aes-xts-plain64</tt> cipher
with a minimum <tt>512</tt> bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.

<br /><br />
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Documentation web site:<br />
